Hareeg is a Middle Eastern card game where players try to get rid of their cards by melding them. The first player to empty their hand wins.

Your goal in this project is to complete the `MeldValid` function inside `Assets/Scripts/MyController.cs` that checks whether a group of selected cards constitutes a valid meld group.
